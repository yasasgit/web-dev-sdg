    <h2>INVESTMENT PROMOTION</h2><br>
    <p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been used by developing countries as a tool to solve their economic problems
        in the recent past.<br>
        Sri Lanka is also not an exception to this practice.<br>
        This research is aimed at tracing the impact of FDI in promoting economic growth by using the time series annual
        data from 1978 - 2012 in Sri Lanka.<br>
        Multiple regression models were used to estimate the impact of FDI on economic growth.<br>
        The Minitab, SAS, Excel and E-views software were used for data analysis.<br>
        The empirical evidence shows that FDI positively and statistically influences to determine economic growth in
        Sri Lanka.<br>
        However, this study further reveals that the actual impact of FDI can be felt after time lag of two years.<br>
