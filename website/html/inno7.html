        <h2>The "Ariyatne Weeder"</h2>
        <p> INNOVATIONS TO REDUCE SRI LABOR REQUIREMENTS
            The "Ariyatne Weeder". &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            Mr. Ariyatne Subasinghe, from Hingurakgoda, Sri Lanka, is shown here with the
            labor-saving motorized weeder he designed. He is cultivating 5 acres (2 ha) with SRI methods and finds
            it
            difficult to do as many weedings as recommended for such an area. So he has developed this weeder, with
            a
            Chinese motor, that he can make for about $750, and which he considers a cost-effective innovation given
            the
            yields he can get with SRI methods.
            An even more interesting innovation is a method of crop establishment he is using this season,
            similar
            to one that Mr. Ramasamy Selvam in Tamil Nadu state of India has started. The goal is to save the labor
            needed to construct and operate a nursery and to do manual transplanting, while still capitalizing on
            the
            benefits of other SRI practices.
            Ariyaratne broadcasts germinated seed at the rate of 25 kg/ha onto a muddy paddy field. The
            resulting
            plants are more dense than the 5-10 kg/ha rate with transplanted SRI, but they are less dense than with
            the
            more usual broadcasting rate of 50-150 kg/ha.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            At 15-20 days, he does a 'first weeding' which reduces the
            plant population as well as any weeds in the field. By doing this in the usual SRI pattern of
            perpendicular
            passes of the weeder, he leaves preferably 1 plant, but possibly 2, at intersections 25x25 cm or 30x30
            cm
            across the whole field. This creates a plant population similar in number and spacing to what would be
            achieved with the presently recommended transplanting method.He continues to do additional weedings
            as
            needed to control weeds and aerate the soil. His motorized weeder makes this task much easier and
            quicker.
            Mr. Selvam in Tamil Nadu broadcasts young seedlings, about 10 days old, rather than germinated seed, and
            then eliminates 'excess' plants not growing at the desired 25x25 cm intersections by his first
            weeding.Farmers
            with very small paddy holdings, who need to maximize their yield per hectare, will get the most benefit
            from
            the recommended careful transplanting of young seedlings. But farmers with larger landholdings, who
            benefit
            most from maximizing their returns per hour of labor, may find this modification of SRI practice
            advantageous, spending more for seed but reducing their labor cost.
