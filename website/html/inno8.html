Niluka has created a new source of livelihood for the women in her area while at the same time introducing a number of eco-friendly and green products to the market, all manufactured using an aquatic weed that is considered invasive and destructive in Sri Lanka. With the correct technical knowledge, Niluka believes she will also be able to assist other Sri Lankan women to create similar products from their very own homes in the future.
				<br>Niluka’s raw material of choice is the invasive weed, Water Hyacinth better known locally as Japan Jabara. Commonly found clogging Sri Lanka’s water sources including agricultural tanks, rivers and even canals, the plant was first introduced to Sri Lanka in 1904 for ornamental purposes. Declared as a prohibited weed under the Water Hyacinth Act in 1909 and subsequently under the Plant Protection Act in 1924, the plant however has managed to spread widely across the country over the years. The effects of the species on Sri Lanka’s farming communities heavily dependent on water sources is severe requiring the Government to allocate a significant amount of funds annually to have it destroyed. But for Niluka and the women of Ehetuwewa, the unwanted weed has become a blessing in disguise and a source of income.
				<br>For nearly four years, Niluka had made handloom and rexine bags for sale after following a course on sewing. But the Easter Sunday attack on April 21 last year had severely impacted her business. “I was not able to purchase rexine materials I needed to make bags following the attack,” she said. Having to stop production as a result, Niluka had thought of alternative raw materials to manufacture her products.
				<br>“At a vocational training programme I attended I had seen a coin purse and a hat made of water hyacinth stems,” she recalled adding that seeing this she had thought of ways to adapt the same method to create the handicrafts she was already manufacturing. “I did not want to copy it and create the same type of purse. I wanted to use the method to create the bags I was already making at the time,” she said. She was also keen to try something different as she had found that buyers were not particularly attracted to cloth and leather bags as they were commonly found. “Many people in the country produce these items. There is nothing special about it,” she said.

				Deciding to replace rexine material with treated water hyacinth stems, Niluka had tried and tested the method she learned at the programme to create her own products only to be proven successful.
				<br>Today Niluka creates bags, backpacks, wedding cake boxes, hats, files, and dustbins using treated water hyacinth stems. “Though at first glance it may appear there is no use of stems, we treat it and get into shape,” she said. According to Niluka, no imported materials are used to create products, and neither is any plastic or polythene is used. The lining used is cotton. “These are completely eco-friendly and green,” she noted. Wedding cake boxes made by her are particularly popular with many young couples who are now opting to have traditional Sri Lankan weddings. Niluka also assures that the bags made by her are of better quality and are also stronger than rexine bags found in the market.
				<br>According to her, since water hyacinth plants are readily available she is able to even fulfil larger customized orders. To help her in the task, Niluka has recruited scores of unemployed women in her community. “Making products from water hyacinths is more time-consuming as it needs a lot of preparation,” she said.

				“There are many women in our community who are unemployed and have not had the opportunity to obtain a good education or vocational training. So I visited the villages in our area and trained the women who were keen to learn how to produce various parts needed to make the final product,” she said. Some women, for example, are tasked with removing water hyacinth weeds from tanks in the area, while others dry the plants and prepare it as required.

				According to Niluka, this has allowed the women in her community to make an additional income to support their families while staying at home.

				But her journey has not been without trials and tribulations. When the COVID-19 spread across Sri Lanka, as many others, Niluka’s business also took a severe hit. “Before COVID-19, we produced nearly 250 bags alone in a month,” she said. However, following COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown, production had to be completely halted, according to Niluka.

				Niluka is also disgruntled about the contracts given out by the authorities to destroy the invasive water hyacinth. According to her, instead, if at least some of it were provided to her it would be a boost to her business. “When the authorities spend Rs. 100,000 to destroy water hyacinths, we can create products worth Rs. 500,000 using the same amount of plants,” she said.

				But, according to Niluka, politicians and businessmen do not like to provide the water hyacinths meant for destruction to local manufacturers such as herself as they will lose their earnings and commissions from such contracts given out. “They don’t care even if it can be used. They forget the less fortunate like us who are working hard to make a living,” she said. Niluka accepts that certain amounts of the plant will have to be destroyed. “But at least the Government should make a procedure so we can obtain some of this for our business,” she noted.

				But despite the problems having started her business due to severe economic hardships she faced, Niluka is determined to continue. “It was not easy. Living in a harsh and rural area with no facilities, I had to come to Colombo for almost everything to do with my business,” she recalled. “But I chose this to earn a livelihood for my family and to protect it while also contributing to my country,” she said. Niluka also wants to help other women in her community and across the country as well.

				As a video of her and her business went viral on social media recently gaining nearly one million views, Niluka said she has been receiving inquiries from both Sri Lanka and abroad. “I believe in my products and its quality so I am sure my business will pick up once more,” she said.

				However, having come this far with little assistance, Niluka now has one request to make from the Government or any well-wisher hoping to assist her. Keen to develop her business further, Niluka said she believes gaining technical knowledge on using the water hyacinth to make products can help her to expand her business. “I do not need funds or any other assistance. I just need assistance to gain the technical knowledge needed,” she said. “Though it’s a new concept to Sri Lanka, it is common in other Asian countries such as Vietnam,” she explained adding that these countries have developed better technical knowledge. “For example, they have found ways to treat the stems to ensure the products last much longer than we are making now,” she noted. “I do not need funds or any other assistance. I just need assistance to gain the technical knowledge needed,” she repeated.

				According to her, obtaining this technical know-how will not only help her expand her business by improving the quality of her products but also assist her in introducing the methods to other local women interested in taking up the business in their own communities across Sri Lanka. “I may not be able to get rid of all the water hyacinths but I can at least help create home industries that will benefit the women of this country and uplift their livelihoods,” she added.
