        <h2>Hand Made Items From Japan Jabara</h2>
        <p>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Ehetuwewa, a rural village in Galgamuwa, nearly 150 Kilometers away from Colombo,
            local entrepreneur
            Niluka Jayanthi is leading a revolution of sorts among the unemployed women in her community. Niluka has
            created a new source of livelihood for the women in her area while at the same time introducing a number
            of
            eco-friendly and green products to the market, all manufactured using an aquatic weed that is considered
            invasive and destructive in Sri Lanka. With the correct technical knowledge, Niluka believes she will
            also
            be able to assist other Sri Lankan women to create similar products from their very own homes in the
            future. </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Niluka's raw material of choice is the invasive weed, Water Hyacinth better known
            locally as Japan
            Jabara. Commonly found clogging Sri Lanka's water sources including agricultural tanks, rivers and even
            canals, the plant was first introduced to Sri Lanka in 1904 for ornamental purposes. Declared as a
            prohibited weed under the Water Hyacinth Act in 1909 and subsequently under the Plant Protection Act in
            1924, the plant however has managed to spread widely across the country over the years. The effects of
            the
            species on Sri Lanka's farming communities heavily dependent on water sources is severe requiring the
            Government to allocate a significant amount of funds annually to have it destroyed. But for Niluka and
            the
            women of Ehetuwewa, the unwanted weed has become a blessing in disguise and a source of income. </p>
        <p>


            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For nearly four years, Niluka had made handloom and rexine bags for sale after
            following a course on
            sewing. But the Easter Sunday attack on April 21 last year had severely impacted her business. "I was
            not
            able to purchase rexine materials I needed to make bags following the attack," she said. Having to stop
            production as a result, Niluka had thought of alternative raw materials to manufacture her
            products. </p>

        <p>


            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"At a vocational training programme I attended I had seen a coin purse and a hat
            made of water hyacinth
            stems," she recalled adding that seeing this she had thought of ways to adapt the same method to create
            the
            handicrafts she was already manufacturing. "I did not want to copy it and create the same type of purse.
            I
            wanted to use the method to create the bags I was already making at the time," she said. She was also
            keen
            to try something different as she had found that buyers were not particularly attracted to cloth and
            leather
            bags as they were commonly found. "Many people in the country produce these items. There is nothing
            special
            about it," she said. </p>


        <p>


            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Deciding to replace rexine material with treated water hyacinth stems, Niluka had
            tried and tested the
            method she learned at the programme to create her own products only to be proven successful.
            Today Niluka creates bags, backpacks, wedding cake boxes, hats, files, and dustbins using treated water
            hyacinth stems. "Though at first glance it may appear there is no use of stems, we treat it and get into
            shape," she said. According to Niluka, no imported materials are used to create products, and neither is
            any
            plastic or polythene is used. The lining used is cotton. "These are completely eco-friendly and green,"
            she
            noted. Wedding cake boxes made by her are particularly popular with many young couples who are now
            opting to
            have traditional Sri Lankan weddings. Niluka also assures that the bags made by her are of better
            quality
            and are also stronger than rexine bags found in the market.</p>

        <p>


            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;According to her, since water hyacinth plants are readily available she is able to
            even fulfil larger
            customized orders. To help her in the task, Niluka has recruited scores of unemployed women in her
            community. "Making products from water hyacinths is more time-consuming as it needs a lot of
            preparation,"
            she said.

            "There are many women in our community who are unemployed and have not had the opportunity to obtain a
            good
            education or vocational training. So I visited the villages in our area and trained the women who were
            keen
            to learn how to produce various parts needed to make the final product," she said. Some women, for
            example,
            are tasked with removing water hyacinth weeds from tanks in the area, while others dry the plants and
            prepare it as required.</p>


        <p>


            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;According to Niluka, this has allowed the women in her community to make an
            additional income to support
            their families while staying at home.

            But her journey has not been without trials and tribulations. When the COVID-19 spread across Sri Lanka,
            as
            many others, Niluka's business also took a severe hit. "Before COVID-19, we produced nearly 250 bags
            alone
            in a month," she said. However, following COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown, production had to be
            completely
            halted, according to Niluka.

            Niluka is also disgruntled about the contracts given out by the authorities to destroy the invasive
            water
            hyacinth. According to her, instead, if at least some of it were provided to her it would be a boost to
            her
            business. "When the authorities spend Rs. 100,000 to destroy water hyacinths, we can create products
            worth
            Rs. 500,000 using the same amount of plants," she said.

            But, according to Niluka, politicians and businessmen do not like to provide the water hyacinths meant
            for
            destruction to local manufacturers such as herself as they will lose their earnings and commissions from
            such contracts given out. "They don't care even if it can be used. They forget the less fortunate like
            us
            who are working hard to make a living," she said. Niluka accepts that certain amounts of the plant will
            have
            to be destroyed. "But at least the Government should make a procedure so we can obtain some of this for
            our
            business," she noted.

            But despite the problems having started her business due to severe economic hardships she faced, Niluka
            is
            determined to continue. "It was not easy. Living in a harsh and rural area with no facilities, I had to
            come
            to Colombo for almost everything to do with my business," she recalled. "But I chose this to earn a
            livelihood for my family and to protect it while also contributing to my country," she said. Niluka also
            wants to help other women in her community and across the country as well.

            As a video of her and her business went viral on social media recently gaining nearly one million views,
            Niluka said she has been receiving inquiries from both Sri Lanka and abroad. "I believe in my products
            and
            its quality so I am sure my business will pick up once more," she said.

            However, having come this far with little assistance, Niluka now has one request to make from the
            Government
            or any well-wisher hoping to assist her. Keen to develop her business further, Niluka said she believes
            gaining technical knowledge on using the water hyacinth to make products can help her to expand her
            business. "I do not need funds or any other assistance. I just need assistance to gain the technical
            knowledge needed," she said. "Though it's a new concept to Sri Lanka, it is common in other Asian
            countries
            such as Vietnam," she explained adding that these countries have developed better technical knowledge.
            "For
            example, they have found ways to treat the stems to ensure the products last much longer than we are
            making
            now," she noted. "I do not need funds or any other assistance. I just need assistance to gain the
            technical
            knowledge needed," she repeated. </p>

        <p>


            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;According to her, obtaining this technical know-how will not only help her expand
            her business by
            improving
            the quality of her products but also assist her in introducing the methods to other local women
            interested
            in taking up the business in their own communities across Sri Lanka. "I may not be able to get rid of
            all
            the water hyacinths but I can at least help create home industries that will benefit the women of this
            country and uplift their livelihoods," she added.</p>
