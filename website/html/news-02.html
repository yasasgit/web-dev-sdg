            <h2>BOI, CSE and Ceylon Chamber to hold first-ever virtual investor forum to attract FDIs</h2>

    <div class="div-news-back">

        <div class="div-news-content">The Board of Investment (BOI), Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and Ceylon Chamber of
            Commerce (CCC) will hold a first-of-its-kind virtual investment forum to collectively promote direct and
            equity investment opportunities in Sri Lanka from 7-9 june.

            The event is expected to attract investment interest from around the world, including high-net-worth
            individuals and institutional investors. The event will discuss the macroeconomic landscape in Sri Lanka and
            will highlight all major projects and ventures open for direct investment while also featuring the
            investment case for CSE-listed companies.

            The virtual forum will be organised considering the convenience of investors based in multiple time zones
            and will feature an eminent line-up of speakers, presenters and panellists including policymakers and
            business leaders who are expected to collectively make the case for investment in Sri Lanka. It will also
            facilitate investors to engage one on one with key project owners and leading listed companies.

            BOI, CSE and CCC unite to organise this initiative to support the Sri Lankan Government’s bid to attract
            foreign inflows into the economy, which is imperative to Sri Lanka’s post-COVID economic revival. The event
            will be organised under the guidance of BOI Chairman Sanjaya Mohottala, CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando and CCC
            Chairman Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya who will offer leadership and direction to the organising committee
            consisting of members of the three institutions. The initiative expects to gather the support of the wider
            stakeholder base in the direct investment and capital market space in Sri Lanka, including BOI and CCC
            members, project promoters, CSE listed companies, stockbroker firms, investment banks and other partners.

            Mohottala said: “BOI, CSE and CCC represent our Government, our capital markets and our private sector, the
            most significant custodians of the economy — and this is a historic coming together of key stakeholders to
            holistically promote Sri Lanka as an investment destination. Many policy changes have been effected last
            year, despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, and this forum is an excellent platform to make
            the global investor community aware of the strong fundamentals we have created, and thereby a much more
            conducive investment climate which is set to usher in a decade of growth for Sri Lanka.”

            Fernando noted that the CSE is looking forward to collaborating with the BOI and CCC to collectively pitch
            the investment case for Sri Lanka adding that, given the current climate, joining forces with these
            institutions is the best approach for maximum impact in the interest of the nation.

            He stated that portfolio investors will be keen to understand the macroeconomic policy direction while the
            format of this forum will offer foreign investors a wider perspective on the growth trajectory and
            investment climate in Sri Lanka as it will also feature direct investment opportunities.

            He noted that while the CSE has over the years engaged foreign investors directly through many Invest Sri
            Lanka forums, a 360-degree country investment pitch of this nature will deliver a more complete picture for
            prospective investors in the CSE.

            Dr. Wijayasuriya said: “As espoused in the recently published Sri Lanka Economic Acceleration Framework
            (SEAF), the Chamber envisions the achievement of a 6-7% growth rate of the Sri Lanka Economy reaching a GDP
            of $ 127.5 billion by the Year 2026. Foreign investment inflows in the forms of FDI, as well as portfolio
            investments, are pivotal levers in achieving this aspiration.

            “Equally, the uplifting of foreign investment inflows, in tandem with parallel initiatives of the public and
            private sectors to bolster exports, domestic production and competitiveness will be foundational in
            bolstering Sri Lanka’s macro-economic indices.

            “The Chamber is privileged to partner with the BOI and CSE in launching this ambitious initiative to present
            Sri Lanka’s investment opportunities to the world on the backdrop of the nation’s bullish Post-COVID
            revival.”
