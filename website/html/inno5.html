        <h2>Respirone Nano AV99</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A 3-PLY FACE MASK MADE OF NANOTECHNOLOGICALLY ENGINEERED
            COTTON
            Researchers from the Faculty of Science, University of Peradeniya have been working hard ever since the
            COVID-19 pandemic commenced in Sri Lanka, about an year ago, by obtaining special permits from our
            police
            department. The researchers wanted to use our knowledge to combat this pandemic by contributing to its
            control. As such, they have developed an antimicrobial pigment to be used in paints to destroy viruses,
            bacterial, fungi and other harmful microorganisms. This was done using the sludge accumulated at the LTL
            Galvanizers Pvt Ltd. The LTL is now working on mass production of this pigment as a means of protecting
            surfaces from SARS CoV-2 attachment. At the same time, they wanted to develop a unique face mask with
            three
            layers from environmentally friendly cotton but to have aerosol particles containing SARS CoV-2 virus
            reflection in the uppermost layer, electrostatic and mechanical retention of the virus if by chance it
            passes through the upper layer and reaches the middle layer and to kill it by five different mechanisms.
            To explain briefly the actions of the three layers:The upper layer is made of cotton
            nano-technologically
            modified to have water repellency (superhydrophobic nature as it does by the lotus leaf). This means
            that if
            any aerosol particle containing the virus reaches the upper layer the particle is repels away and thrown
            out. This property also ensures cleanliness of the surface due to its non-wetting nature (The lotus leaf
            and
            swan's feathers are also very clean due to the same reason). Therefore, the mask is an advanced version
            of a
            surgical mask since any blood fallen on it is also repelled without letting go through.</p>

        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            The middle layer is also cotton but it is made by blocking the pores of the cotton cloth using
            microparticles just the size of the pores to ensure no particle penetration through it but to have free
            passage for molecules in air to ensure good breathability. The particles used have a positively charged
            surface so that they attract the negatively charged SARS CoV-2 viral envelope and bind electrostatically
            on
            their surface. The middle layer surface also contains star-shaped nanoparticles with sharp nanoblades
            capable of cutting the virus's spike proteins as the way you cut them using scissors. This is a unique
            characteristic since microbes cannot develop any resistance for this physical action of disruption.
            Therefore, the nanoparticles are capable of destroying not only the present variants of SARS CoV-2 but
            any
            future mutations and hybrid versions since all of them have these spike proteins which can be cut to
            pieces
            by our nanoblades. There are four other mechanisms by which these nanoparticles can destroy the virus
            but
            this physical action is the dominant one.</p>

        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
            As said, the uppermost layer reflects the aerosol particles without allowing them to pass through. By
            any
            chance if they pass through and reach the middle layer, they are retained on it by two mechanisms and
            destroyed by five mechanisms. Therefore, these two layers of the mask ensure that the wearer does not
            get
            the virus. The virus killing efficiency was measured at our Virology Unit of the Microbiology Department
            of
            the Faculty of Medicine using a similar coronavirus called SRV and found that at half the concentration
            used
            the nanoparticles completely killed all the viruses giving Zero RSV Antigen Cell Viability. The
            materials
            were also tested for various bacteria and found that it kills all the bacteria types that we have
            studied.
            Therefore, the researchers are confident that this middle layer does not allow any viral or bacterial
            particle to pass through.</p>

        <p> The innermost face contact layer is made of water-loving (hydrophilic) cotton for moisture absorption
            from
            the perspiration and to allow for easy evaporation in order to give maximum comfort to the wearer. There
            is
            no such advanced face mask so far developed anywhere in the world and hence it should have a high market
            potential.</p>
