        <h3>F1 CAR</h3>
        <p>Team Shark has managed to become a symbol of perseverance, dedication and passion for the island nation
            of Sri Lanka, not because of massive financial assets or extremely advanced manufacturing processes, but
            because of sheer passion shown by a group of young and daring engineering undergraduates to create
            history by taking part in the Formula Student UK 2016 event for the first time, from Sri Lanka,
            representing the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa.


            As a first time team, our car suffers from overweight issues and unoptimized design solutions in some
            parts of the car, mostly due to the difficulties in obtaining funds, bottlenecks in purchasing and
            processing materials, lag in the manufacturing technologies used, compared with the rest of the world,
            and most importantly, lack of experience. Running on a 2008 Honda CBR600 EFI engine setting power down
            to the Hoosier slicks though the Drexler LSD differential, the DIMORA P1 is surely not a competition
            winner. However, from the days of initiation of Team Shark back in 2015, through a painfully slow
            process of manufacturing a chassis with no funding or advanced manufacturing facilities, we have manage
            to emerge from nothing to take form as a possible contender in future years to come. With nothing but
            passion for engineering and racing, we managed to win the admiration of Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC
            (DIMO), Sri Lanka, as sole sponsor, and managed to obtain funding and support to take part in the event.
            We will be funded by DIMO PLC, Sri Lanka in all aspects of logistics in getting our car to the UK for
            the competition, to which we are very grateful.</p>

            Our objectives are simple. Pursue the impossible dream. Challenge reality. Create the ultimate Formula
            Student race car.
            A car is pretty complex piece of machinery if you think about it, despite the fact that we are
            surrounded by them on a daily basis. A racing car gets even more complicated, and a Formula one doubly
            so. You'd need an ultra-lightweight chassis that's also strong enough to handle the stress of a race, an
            engine powerful enough to push the car upwards of 300 kmph, materials that can withstand the high
            horsepower, seamless shift transmissions, aerodynamics, specialised tires, brakes, and custom fuel
            mixtures. Formula One cars are usually constructed by the racing teams themselves, who have access to
            the large amount of resources needed to construct such a specialised machine. Constructors like Ferrari,
            McLaren, and Red Bull have the necessary specialists, equipment, and money to build world-class Formula
            One racing car, which would cost upwards of 7 million dollars. Building a Formula car is not really the
            sort of project you can take on for a science fair.</p>
