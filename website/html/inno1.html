				Dr. Harsha Subasinghe and co-founder Dr Beshan Kulapala. By 2015 Vega Innovations introduced the first
				prototype of Vega EVX capable of generating over 900 hp and reaching 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds.
				In 2017 the first Vega EVX prototype was built with the company expecting commercial production to begin over the coming years.
				Vega EVX prototype has two 300 kW (408 hp) electric motors each positioned on the front and rear axles,
				providing it with all-wheel drive and allowing it a cumulative power of 600 kW (816 hp) and 760 Nm of torque.
				 The EVX initially receives a small LiFePo4 (lithium iron phosphate) battery with a capacity of 55 kWh,
				 placed in the rear center position, allowing it a range of 300 km (187 mph), before the arrival of a larger
				 battery of 130 kWh increasing its autonomy to
				250 km (155 mph).and from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 3.1 seconds with a top speed of 240 km (150 mph).
                VEGA Innovations has described the production version of the Vega EVX can accelerate from 0â€“100 km/h in less than 2.0 seconds,
				and achieve a top speed of 380 km/h (236 mph) with a 750 km battery range
