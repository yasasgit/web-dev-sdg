				<br>The smart appliance developed by the Navy’s Research and Development Unit based on a basic concept proposed by Thushara Kelum Wadasinghe, an inventor will allow healthcare workers to remain at a safe distance from the highly infectious patients.
				<br>The Navy handed over the robotic appliance for use at the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital Wednesday.
				<br>This smart appliance will also help healthcare workers to diagnose ailments, communicate with patients and dispense medicine and meals to them, without getting closer to the infected people.
				<br>The remote-controlled device also has an automated nozzle which sprays a stream of sanitizing liquid to the hands of the patient, allowing him/her to sanitize the hands before touching any equipment or drugs placed on the device.
				<br>As such, this innovative appliance will help protect doctors and healthcare workers from the highly contagious novel coronavirus, when they are dealing with COVID-19 patients.
				<br>The Research and Development Unit of Sri Lanka Navy has also developed a disinfection chamber recently and similar chambers, with added features, have been set up at Kalubowila Teaching Hospital, Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and University Hospital KDU.
