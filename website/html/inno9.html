        <h2>Sri Lanka Navy develops remote-controlled smart appliance to test and treat COVID-19 patients</h2><br><br>
        <p>Apr 09, Colombo: Sri Lanka Navy has developed a remote-controlled smart appliance called ‘Medi Mate’ in a bid
            to treat and test COVID-19 patients from a safe distance.
            <br>The smart appliance developed by the Navy’s Research and Development Unit based on a basic concept
            proposed by Thushara Kelum Wadasinghe, an inventor will allow healthcare workers to remain at a safe
            distance from the highly infectious patients.
            <br>The Navy handed over the robotic appliance for use at the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital
            Wednesday.
            <br>This smart appliance will also help healthcare workers to diagnose ailments, communicate with patients
            and dispense medicine and meals to them, without getting closer to the infected people.
            <br>The remote-controlled device also has an automated nozzle which sprays a stream of sanitizing liquid to
            the hands of the patient, allowing him/her to sanitize the hands before touching any equipment or drugs
            placed on the device.
            <br>As such, this innovative appliance will help protect doctors and healthcare workers from the highly
            contagious novel coronavirus, when they are dealing with COVID-19 patients.
            <br>The Research and Development Unit of Sri Lanka Navy has also developed a disinfection chamber recently
            and similar chambers, with added features, have been set up at Kalubowila Teaching Hospital, Neville
            Fernando Teaching Hospital and University Hospital KDU.
