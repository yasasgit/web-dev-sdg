        <h2>Over 150 investor meetings facilitated during Sri Lanka Investment Forum 2021</h2>
        <p>The recently-concluded Sri Lanka Investment Forum 2021 (SLIF 2021), organised by the Board of Investment,
            the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Colombo Stock Exchange, facilitated one-to-one meetings between
            foreign investors and FDI project promoters and listed corporates.
            The forum facilitated over 150 virtual meetings which were seen as productive by foreign investors as well
            as the participating Sri Lankan institutions.
            Leading Sri Lankan institutions who joined the forum to present Sri Lanka's investment propositions included
            State institutions, listed companies,
            investment banks and consulting firms from over 18 industry sectors. The virtual platform provided a
            convenient environment for investors and promoters to set up meetings at mutually convenient times.
            The platform also enabled query and chat facilities which facilitated rapid responses to investor queries
            many of which are expected to result in deeper follow up engagements going forward.
            Commenting on these meetings, BOI Chairman Sanjaya Mohottala said: "We are very encouraged by the response
            from international investors for the FDI projects showcased at SLIF,
            with a significant number of project partners connecting one-on-one during the B2B sessions over the three
            days, with more meetings scheduled in the coming weeks.
            For the FDI side, prospective investors had a catalogue of almost 50 -scale FDI projects valued at over $ 5
            billion,
            detailing opportunities to invest in Sri Lanka across multiple sectors ranging from hospitality and leisure,
            infrastructure, renewable energy to oil and gas."<br/><br/>

            CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando said: "The SLIF provided excellent results with a large number of foreign
            investors speaking directly with listed companies virtually at a time when physical investor meetings are
            not possible.
            From the perspective of Sri Lankan listed companies, many were delighted by the new and diverse investors
            they were introduced to at the forum.
            At the same time, investors were pleased to see the breadth of information and transparency achieved through
            the SLIF which would be useful in their future investment decisions."
